# 1 Feature Overview
#### VLAN

* Add support for admin state configuration to bring the VLAN interface up or down using KLISH CLI commmand -"[no] shutdown", REST or gNMI. 
* VLAN interface will be Operationally down when admin state is down, irrespective of the autostate setting and members oper state.  
* When the VLAN interface is "administratively down" or "shutdown", the L3 functions within that VLAN will be disabled, and L2 traffic will continue to flow.
* By default, the VLAN's state in kernel is down and changes to up only when first port/LAG in the VLAN is oper up or autostate is disabled and admin state is up.

#### Loopback

* Add support for admin state configuration via KLISH CLI option-"[no] shutdown", REST or gNMI. 
* By default, admin state & oper state is up. 

## 1.1 Target Deployment Use Cases
Enable/disable VLAN and Loopback interfaces via gNMI, REST or KLISH CLI.

## 1.2 Requirements

### 1.2.1 Functional requirements
1. Provide management framework capability to handle admin state configuration for VLAN & Loopback interfaces.

### 1.2.2 Configuration and Management Requirements

#### 1.2.2.1 KLISH requirements

1. To administratively bring the VLAN and Loopback interface down, use "shutdown" command.
2. To return the interface to its default admin state, use "no shutdown".
3. The above configurations should be displayed as part of a show command.  

## 1.3 Design Overview

### 1.3.1 Basic Approach
#### 1.3.1.1 VLAN

1. The VLAN table in the CONFIG_DB supports admin state up/down parameter.
2. The VlanMgr to be enhanced to populate the APP_DB with the admin state up/down.
3. The orchagent to be enhanced to update VLAN's oper state based on admin state. 
   The contributors to the the operational status are as follows: 
   - Admin state.
   - Autostate.
   - Physical Port members.
   - LAG members.
4. When the configuration changes from admin state up to down the operational status will change to operationally down. If the state were to be already operationally down then it will be a no-op. 
5. When the configuration changes from admin down to up the operational status will change to operationally up based on autostate and members operational state.  
6. For the VLAN state in kernel, the existing mechanism to notify the VlanMgr about the operational status will be reused. 

#### 1.3.1.2 LOOPBACK
1. Update LOOPBACK table in the CONFIG_DB to support admin state up/down parameter.
2. The LOOPBACK_TABLE in APP_DB already supports admin state up/down parameter.
3. The oper status will be controlled by the admin status. 
4. When the configuration changes from admin state up to down the operational status will change to operationally down.  
5. When the configuration changes from admin down to up the operational status will change to operationally up.   

### 1.3.2 Container
* **swss container** : 
  * VlanMgr and Orchagent changes to also consider admin status while setting oper status.
* **management-framework** :
  * CLI XML & Jinja-template changes to support CLI-style configurations and relevant show commands.

```
leaf admin_status {
    type scommon:admin-status;
}
```
#### LOOPBACK

leaf admin_status {
    type scommon:admin-status;
}
```

### 3.6.2 CLI
#### 3.6.2.1 Configuration Commands

#### VLAN
```
sonic(conf-if-Vlan100)# [no] shutdown
sonic(conf-if-range-vl**)# [no] shutdown
```
#### LOOPBACK
```
sonic(conf-if-lo10)# [no] shutdown
```

#### 3.6.2.2 Show Commands

#### VLAN
* "show vlan" displays the Vlan Interfaceâ€™s operational status.
```
sonic# show Vlan
Q: A - Access (Untagged), T - Tagged
NUM        Status      Q Ports        AutoState
100        Inactive    T  Ethernet0   Enable
                       T  Ethernet1
101        Active      T  Ethernet1   Disable
```
* "show interface vlan" displays both the Admin & Oper status
```
sonic(config)# do show interface Vlan 1
Vlan1 is up, line protocol is down
Mode of IPV4 address assignment: not-set
Mode of IPV6 address assignment: not-set
Interface IPv6 oper status: Disabled
IP MTU 9100 bytes
sonic(config)#
```
* "show configuration" to display "shutdown" configuration.  
```
sonic(config)# do show running-configuration interface Vlan 11
!
interface Vlan11
 shutdown
```

#### LOOPBACK
* "show interface Loopback" to display both admin status and oper status, currently only oper status is shown.
```
sonic#show interface Loopback 10
Loopback 10 is up, line protocol is up
Mode of IPV4 address assignment: not-set
Mode of IPV6 address assignment: not-set
Interface IPv6 oper status: Disabled

```
* "show configuration" to display "shutdown" configuration.  
```
sonic(config)# do show running-configuration interface loopback 11
!
interface Loopback 11
 shutdown
```

#### 3.6.2.3 Exec Commands

gNMI operations will be supported using OC yang configuration objects & state objects.

## 3.7 Warm Boot Support
No impact to warm boot support due to this enhancement. 

## 3.8 Upgrade and Downgrade Considerations
By default the admin state is up. Upgrade from an earlier release will have all the 
configured VLANs in an admin state up state. There will be no change in behavior from the
earlier releases. The user has an option to change the admin state configuration post upgrade.
